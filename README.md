Parkinson's Therapy vibrating gloves

Peter Tass at Stanford is currently doing a study about using vibrating gloves to treat Parkinson's. So far, the results appear to be amazing. It's probably going to be a while until they will be available so this is a repository of information and progress on homemade gloves.

Hardware:
So far, this is what I'm coming up with:

Microcontroller - ATMega328P - https://www.ebay.com/itm/165781280431
Driver chip (Will need two) ULN2803A - https://www.amazon.com/ULN2803A-Darlington-Current-Electric-Component/dp/B08C5B1S47
Vibrating Motors - Either ERM or LRA types. 
Rotary Controller - https://www.amazon.com/Maxmoral-Encoder-Degrees-Compatible-Development/dp/B07M631J1Q
LCD - https://www.amazon.com/GeeekPi-Character-Backlight-Raspberry-Electrical/dp/B07S7PJYM6/

To make this easily reproducible, this might help:
